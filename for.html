       <p>Remember when I used to think you were cool? Yeah, me neither. Just kidding! You're still the coolest, even if your dance moves are straight out of the '80s. Thanks for being the awesome, slightly embarrassing big brother that keeps life interesting. Love you, even if your jokes are as old as you are!</p>
    <p>I've been thinking about you and s lately. She's such an amazing person, and I can see how much joy she brings into your life. Please remember to cherish and care for her - a happy wife makes a happy life, right?

        Let her know how much she means to you, and don't forget the little gestures that show you care. If she's smiling, I know you're doing something right. If there's ever anything you need or if you just want to talk, I'm here.</p>
